Implementations of Seven Languages in Seven Weeks
=

My first at Hacker School will be experimenting with the various languages
discussed in Bruce Tate's "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks".

An initial project that I will be experimenting with will be association
rule mining using the Apriori algorithm. This will consist of two components.

1. Extracting frequent itemsets from a list of transactions
2. Generating highly-confident association rules from these frequent itemsets.
